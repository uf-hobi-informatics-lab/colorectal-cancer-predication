# colorectal-cancer-predication
Prediction of colorectal cancer onset under 50 years old through a machine learning approach using real-world data

# Model
We apply machine learning algorithms including LR, SVMs, RFs, and GBT.

# Action Steps:
1.	Refine data preprocessing pipeline
2.	Apply PSM on case control matching
3.	Hyperparameter tuning (LR, RF, SVM and GBDT)
4.	Running each model 100 time and calculate confident interval
